## Contribution guidelines

Every form of contribution is welcome, including documentation improvements, tests, bug fixes, and feature implementations.

Please follow these guidelines to contribute to the project:

- Make sure your changes match the documentation and coding style of the project, including [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) type annotations.
- `mypy` is used to type-check the codebase, submitted code should not produce typing errors. See [this page](http://mypy-lang.org/) for more information on `mypy`.
- _Small_ fixes can be submitted simply by creating a pull request.
- Non-trivial changes should have an associated [issue](#community-guidelines) in the issue tracker that commits must reference (typically by adding `#refs <issue-id>` to the end of commit messages).
- Please write [tests](#testing) for the changes you make (if applicable).

If you have any questions about contributing to the project, please contact the project owner.

As mentioned in the [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines), the project is type-checked using `mypy`, so first of all, the project must pass `mypy`'s static code analysis.

The project is tested using `pytest`. The chosen test layout is that tests are outside the application code, see [this page](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#tests-outside-application-code) for details on what it means in practice.

If `pytest` is installed, the test set can be executed using the `pytest test` command from within the project directory.

If `pytest-cov` is also installed, a test coverage report can be generated by executing `pytest test --cov markyp_bootstrap4` from the root directory of the project.
